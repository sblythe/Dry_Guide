# Welcome to the Blythe Dry Lab Guide

The dry lab guide details the computational resources and tasks used in the Blythe Lab.

At present, the guide focuses on providing instruction on getting on to the Northwestern University Quest Computing cluster, and testing that you are set up to use those resources. Future updates will include descriptions of standard approaches for processing raw genomic data (FastQ) for computational analysis.
